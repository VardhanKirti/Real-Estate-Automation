/**
 * The gate's decision table. Pure and edge-safe (no node: imports) so the
 * middleware can run it and the tests can cover every branch without a server.
 *
 * Model:
 *   - no password set   → open on this machine only (loopback Host); any other
 *                         Host is refused with 503 until a password exists.
 *   - password set      → every page and API route needs the session cookie.
 *   - always            → mutating cross-origin requests are refused (CSRF).
 *
 * The loopback rule is judged on the Host header, which a remote client can
 * forge. That is why `scripts/serve.mjs` refuses to bind to anything but
 * 127.0.0.1 while no password exists: the network never reaches this code in
 * that state. The Host check is the second layer, for `next dev` run by hand.
